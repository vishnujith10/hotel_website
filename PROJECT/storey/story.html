            <h2>How technology has helped restaurants adapt</h2>
            <p>Restaurant adaptability is more important in 2020 than ever before.The pressures of an ever-changing world, especially during COVID-19, have forced <br> restaurants to make huge technological changes practically overnight.</p>
            <h2> Mobile ordering</h2>
            <p>Because quarantines have closed down restaurant floors, ordering online has almost become the new norm. Restaurants that quickly pivoted to online <br> ordering, drive-throughs, and carry out food were able to maintain steady business. Mobile ordering technology also reduces wait time for customers,
                <br>  making fast food even faster.</p>
                <h2>
                    Online reviews
                </h2>
                <p>Online reviews have changed the restaurant landscape forever by giving an immense amount of  control to consumers. In a world where any bad 
                   <br> experience can turn away potential visitors, restaurants must step up their service, cleanliness, and food quality. Restaurants adjusting to new CDC 
                  <br> guidelines have to be ever-conscious of their actions so as not to attract social shaming. If an employee is wearing a mask incorrectly (or not at all),
                 <br>  if a table looks dirty, if in-person dining capacities are surpassed, or if gloves arenâ€™t changed frequently enough, customers will let the world know 
                <br> about it through online reviews and social media.</p>
                <h2>How technology has helped restaurants operate</h2>
                <p>There are plenty of restaurant BOH and FOH operations technologies and companies. They have many different purposes and help restaurants 
                    <br> accomplish different goals. Three of the biggest ways technology helps restaurants is with their digital food safety, employee performance, and team accountability.</p>
                    <h2>Digital Food safety</h2>
                    <p>Digital food safety improves food quality and helps avoid food safety disasters. Digital tools help restaurant owners serve hot, fresh food with quick
                       br  temperature probes, automated temperature monitoring, and food & date labeling. Put simply, digital food safety helps restaurants be compliant and <br> serve hot fresh food.</p>
